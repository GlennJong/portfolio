## About Me

Hi, I’m Glenn.
I’m a Frontend Engineer with over 6 years of experience, and I’ve been part of 30+ projects over the past 9 years, covering UI design, frontend, and even some full-stack work.

I love taking inspiration from daily life to build side projects that help me and my friends, and I’m always picking up new tech and figuring out how to adapt to different development environments.

I’m always eager to explore new technologies—whether in frontend, beyond frontend, or AI—because I believe learning new skills allows me to tackle more challenging problems and create meaningful solutions.

Below are some of the projects I’ve been part of, showing how I apply my curiosity and problem-solving mindset across different technologies.
